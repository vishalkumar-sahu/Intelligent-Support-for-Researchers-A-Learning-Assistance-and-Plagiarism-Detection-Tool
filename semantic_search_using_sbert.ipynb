F. Hegel, Arthur Schopenhauer, Auguste Comte, John Stuart Mill and Charles Darwin.', \"[37][38] He became fascinated with the evolutionism of Herbert Spencer and corresponded with him,[39][40]

(principal of Christian College, Calcutta; from where Narendra graduated) wrote, \"Narendra is really a genius.', 'I have travelled far and wide but I have never come across a lad of his talents and possibilities, even in German universities, among philosophical students.', 'He is bound to make his mark in life\".', '[42]\\nNarendra was known for his prodigious memory and the ability at speed reading.', 'Several incidents have been given as examples.', 'In a talk, he once quoted verbatim, two or three pages from Pickwick Papers.', 'Another incident that is given is his argument with a Swedish national where he gave reference to some details on Swedish history that the Swede originally disagreed with but later conceded.', \"In another incident with Dr. Paul Deussen's at Kiel in Germany, Vivekananda was going over some poetical work and did not reply when the professor spoke to him.\", 'Later, he apologised to Dr. Deussen explaining that he was too absorbed in reading and hence did not hear him.', 'The professor was not satisfied with this explanation, but Vivekananda quoted and interpreted verses from the text, leaving the professor dumbfounded about his feat of memory.', 'Once, he requested some books written by Sir John Lubbock from a library and returned them the very next day, claiming that he had read them.', 'The librarian refused to believe him, until

does not make a difference between english and English.', 'Disclaimer: The team releasing BERT did not write a model card for this model so this model card has been written by the Hugging Face team.', 'BERT is a transformers model pretrained on a large corpus of English data in a self-supervised fashion.', 'This means it was pretrained on the raw texts only, with no humans labeling them in any way (which is why it can use lots of publicly available data) with an automatic process to generate inputs and labels from those texts.', 'More precisely, it was pretrained with two objectives.', 'Masked language modeling (MLM): taking a sentence, the model randomly masks 15% of the words in the input then run the entire masked sentence through the model and has to predict the masked words.', 'This is different from traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that usually see the words one after the other, or from autoregressive models like GPT which internally masks the future tokens.', 'It allows the model to learn a bidirectional representation of the sentence.', 'Next sentence prediction (NSP): the models concatenates two masked sentences as inputs during pretraining.', 'Sometimes they correspond to sentences that were next to each other in the original text, sometimes not.', 'The model then has to predict if the two sentences were following each other or not.', 'This way, the model learns an inner representation of the English language that can then be used to extract features useful for downstream tasks: if you have a dataset of labeled sentences, for instance, you can train a standard classifier using the features produced by the BERT model as inputs.', 'BERT has originally been released in base and large variations, for cased and uncased input text.', 'The uncased models also strips out an accent markers.', 'Chinese and multilingual uncased and cased versions followed shortly after.', 'Modified preprocessing with whole word masking has replaced subpiece masking in a following work, with the release of two models.', 'Other 24 smaller models are released afterward.', \"You can use the raw model for either masked language modeling or next sentence prediction, but it's mostly intended to be fine-tuned on a downstream task.\", 'See the model hub to look for fine-tuned versions of a task that interests you.', 'Note that this model is primarily aimed at being fine-tuned on tasks that use the whole sentence (potentially masked) to make decisions, such as sequence classification, token classification or question answering.', 'For tasks such as text generation you should look at model like GPT2.', 'There are significant benefits to using a pretrained model.', 'It reduces computation costs, your carbon footprint, and allows you to use state-of-the-art models without having to train one from scratch.Transformers provides access to thousands of pretrained models for a wide range of tasks.', 'When you use a pretrained model, you train it on a dataset specific to your task.', 'This is known as fine-tuning, an incredibly powerful training technique.', 'In this tutorial, you will fine-tune a pretrained model with a deep learning framework of your choice:\\n\\nFine-tune a pretrained model with Transformers Trainer.', 'Fine-tune a pretrained model in TensorFlow with Keras.', 'Fine-tune a pretrained model in native PyTorch.', 'Before you can fine-tune a pretrained model, download a dataset and prepare it for training.', 'The previous tutorial showed you how to process data for training, and now you get an opportunity to put those skills to the test.', 'At this point, you should follow the section corresponding to the framework you want to use.', 'You can use the links in the right sidebar to jump to the one you want - and if you want to hide all of the content for a given framework, just use the button at the top-right of that framework’s block.', 'Next, create a TrainingArguments class which contains all the hyperparameters you can tune as well as flags for activating different training options.', 'For this tutorial you can start with the default training hyperparameters, but feel free to experiment with these to find your optimal settings.', 'Specify where to save the checkpoints from your training:\\n\\nWhen you want to train a Transformers model with the Keras API, you need to convert your dataset to a format that Keras understands.', 'If your dataset is small, you can just convert the whole thing to NumPy arrays and pass it to Keras.', 'Let’s try that first before we do anything more complicated.', 'First, load a dataset.', 'We’ll use the CoLA dataset from the GLUE benchmark, since it’s a simple binary text classification task, and just take the training split for now.You don’t have to pass a loss argument to your models when you compile() them!', 'Hugging Face models automatically choose a loss that is appropriate for their task and model architecture if this argument is left blank.', 'You can always override this by specifying a loss yourself if you want to.', 'Note that in the code sample above, you need to pass the tokenizer to prepare_tf_dataset so it can correctly pad batches as they’re loaded.', 'If all the samples in your dataset are the same length and no padding is necessary, you can skip this argument.', 'If you need to do something more complex than just padding samples (e.g.', 'corrupting tokens for masked language modelling), you can use the collate_fn argument instead to pass a function that will be called to transform the list of samples into a batch and apply any preprocessing you want.', 'See our examples or notebooks to see this approach in action.', 'Narendra Modi was born and raised in Vadnagar in north-eastern Gujarat, where he

of Open Learning (SOL)[67] at the University of Delhi.', '[47] graduating with a third class.', '[68] In 1983, he received a Master of Arts degree in political science from Gujarat University, graduating with a first class[69][70] as an external distance learning student.', '[71] There is a controversy surrounding his educational qualification.', '[72][73]\\nIn June 1975, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declared a state of emergency in India that lasted until 1977.', 'During this period, known as \"the Emergency\", many of her political opponents were jailed and opposition groups were banned.', '[74][75] Modi was appointed general secretary of the \"Gujarat Lok Sangharsh Samiti\", an RSS committee co-ordinating opposition to the Emergency in Gujarat.', 'Shortly afterwards, the RSS was banned.', '[76] Modi was forced to go underground in Gujarat and frequently travelled in disguise to avoid arrest, once dressing as a monk and once as a Sikh.', '[77] He became involved in the printing of pamphlets opposing the government, sending them to Delhi and organising demonstrations.', '[78][79] He was also involved with creating a network of safe houses for individuals who were wanted by the government, and in raising funds for political refugees and activists.', '[80] During this period, Modi wrote a Gujarati-language book titled Sangharsh Ma Gujarat (In the Struggles of Gujarat), which describes events during the Emergency.', '[81][82] While in this role, Modi met trade unionist and socialist activist George Fernandes and several other national political figures.', \"[83]\\n\\nModi became an RSS sambhag pracharak (regional organiser) in 1978, overseeing activities in Surat and Vadodara, and in 1979, he went to work for the RSS in Delhi, where he researched and wrote the RSS's history of the Emergency.\", 'Shortly after, he returned to Gujarat and in 1985, the RSS assigned him to the BJP.', \"In 1987, Modi helped organise the BJP's campaign in the Ahmedabad municipal election, which the party won comfortably; according to biographers, Modi's planning was responsible for the win.\", \"[84][85] After L. K. Advani became president of the BJP in 1986, the RSS decided to place its members in important positions within the party; Modi's work during the Ahmedabad election led to his selection for this

approximately 60 people.', '[j][101] The train carried a large number of Hindu pilgrims who were returning from Ayodhya after a religious ceremony at the site of the demolished Babri Masjid.', '[102][103] In a public statement, Modi said local Muslims were responsible for the incident.', '[7][102][104] The next day, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad called for a bandh (general strike) across the state.', '[105][106] Riots began during the bandh and anti-Muslim violence spread through Gujarat.', \"[102][105][106] The government's decision to move the bodies of the train victims from Godhra to

2,000,[102][101][108] the vast majority of them Muslims.', '[101] Approximately 150,000 people were driven to refugee camps.', '[109] Numerous women and children were among the victims; the violence included mass rapes and mutilation of women.', '[6][110]\\n\\nScholars consider the Government of Gujarat to have been complicit in the riots,[7][111] and it has received much criticism for its handling of the situation;[112] some scholars explicitly blame Modi.', '[6][113][114] The Modi government imposed a curfew in 26 major cities, issued shoot-at-sight orders and called for the army to patrol the streets; these measured failed to prevent the violence from escalating.', '[105][106] The president of the state unit of the BJP expressed support for the bandh despite such actions being illegal at the time.', '[7] State officials later prevented riot victims from leaving the refugee camps, which were often unable to meet the needs of those living there.', '[115] Muslim victims of the riots were subjected to further discrimination when the state government announced their compensation would be half that offered to Hindu victims; this decision was later reversed after the issue was taken to court.', '[116] During the riots, police officers often did not intervene in situations where they were able.', '[6][104][117] Several scholars have described the violence as a pogrom and others have called it an example of state terrorism.', '[118][119][120] According to Martha Nussbaum; \"There is by now a broad consensus that the Gujarat violence was a form of ethnic cleansing, that in many ways it was premeditated, and that it was carried out with the complicity of the state government and officers of the law\".', \"[6]\\n\\nModi's personal involvement in the 2002 events has continued to be debated.\", 'During the riots, he said; \"What is happening is a chain of action and reaction\".', '[6] Later in 2002, Modi said the way in which he had handled the media was his only regret regarding the episode.', '[121] In March 2008, the Supreme Court of India reopened several cases related to the riots, including that of the Gulbarg Society massacre, and established a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to look into the issue.', \"[112][122][123] In response to a petition from Zakia Jafri, the widow of Ehsan Jafri, who was killed in the Gulbarg Society massacre, in April 2009, the court also asked the SIT to investigate Modi's complicity in the killings.\", '[122] The SIT questioned Modi in March 2010; in May, it presented to the court a report finding no evidence against him.', '[122][124] In July 2011, the court-appointed amicus curiae Raju Ramachandran submitted his final report to the court.', \"Contrary to the SIT's position, Ramachandran said Modi could be prosecuted based on the available evidence.\", \"[125][126] The Supreme Court sent the matter to the magistrate's court.\", \"The SIT examined Ramachandran's report, and in March 2012 submitted its final report, asking for the case to be closed.\", 'Zakia Jafri filed a protest petition in response.', \"In December 2013, the magistrate's court rejected the protest petition, accepting the SIT's finding there was no evidence against Modi.\", '[127] In 2022, the Supreme Court dismissed a petition by Zakia Jafri in which she challenged the clean chit given to Modi in the riots by the SIT, and upheld previous rulings that no evidence against him was found.', '[128][129][130]\\n\\nLater terms as Chief Minister\\nMain article: 2002 Gujarat Legislative Assembly election\\nFollowing the

but it was not accepted.', '[132] Despite opposition from the election commissioner, who said a number of voters were still displaced, Modi succeeded in advancing the election to December 2002.', '[133] In the election, the BJP won 127 seats in the 182-member assembly.', '[134] Modi made significant use of anti-Muslim rhetoric during his campaign,[135][136][137][138] and the BJP profited from religious polarisation among voters.', '[133] Modi framed the criticism of his government for human rights violations as an attack upon Gujarati pride,[5][135] a strategy that led to the BJP winning 127 of the 182[134]seats—a two-thirds majority—in the state assembly.', '[5][135] He won Maninagar constituency, defeating INC candidate Yatin Oza.', '[139] On 22 December 2002, Modi was sworn in for a second term.', \"[140]\\n\\nDuring Modi's second term, the government's rhetoric shifted from Hindutva to Gujarat's economic development.\", '[94][5][135] He curtailed the influence of Sangh Parivar organisations such as Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) and Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP).', \"[141] When the BKS staged a farmers' demonstration, Modi ordered the BKS's eviction from state-provided houses,

textbook by Dinanath Batra, which stated ancient India possessed technologies including test-tube babies.', \"[143][144]\\n\\nModi's relationship with Muslims continued to attract criticism.\", \"Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee distanced himself, reaching out to North Indian Muslims before the 2004 Indian general election, following which, Vajpayee called the violence in Gujarat a reason for the BJP's electoral defeat and said it had been a mistake to leave Modi in office after the riots.\", \"[145][146] Western nations also raised questions about Modi's relationship with Muslims; the US State Department barred him from entering the United States in accordance with the recommendations of that country's Commission on International Religious Freedom,[147][148] the only person to be denied a US visa under this law.\", '[147] The UK and the European Union (EU) refused to admit Modi because of what they saw as his role in the riots.', 'As Modi rose to prominence in India, the UK[149] and the EU[150] lifted their bans in October 2012 and March 2013, respectively, and after his election as prime minister in 2014, the US lifted its ban and invited him to Washington,

the BJP intensified its rhetoric on terrorism.', '[153] Modi criticised Prime Minister Manmohan Singh \"for his reluctance to revive anti-terror legislation\" such as the 2002 Prevention of Terrorism Act.', '[154] In 2007, Modi wrote Karmayog, a 101-page booklet discussing manual scavenging.', 'In it, he said scavenging is a \"spiritual experience\" for Valmiks, a sub-caste of Dalits.', '[155][156] The book was not circulated at that time because of the election code of conduct.', '[157] After the November 2008 Mumbai attacks, the Gujarat government authorized the deployment of 30 high-speed boats for coastal surveillance.', '[158] In July 2007, Modi completed 2,063 consecutive days as chief minister of Gujarat, making him the longest-serving holder of that post.', \"[159] The

refused to wear articles of clothing gifted by Muslim leaders.', '[135] He did, however, maintain relations with Dawoodi Bohra.', \"[135] Modi's 2012 campaign included references to issues known to cause religious polarisation, including Afzal Guru and the death of Sohrabuddin Sheikh.\", 'The BJP did not nominate any Muslim candidates for the 2012 assembly election.', '[135] During the 2012 campaign, Modi attempted to identify himself with the state of Gujarat, a strategy similar to that used by Indira Gandhi during the Emergency, and projected himself as protecting Gujarat against persecution by the rest of India.', '[135] While campaigning for the 2012 Gujarat Legislative Assembly election, Modi made extensive use of holograms and other technologies, allowing him to reach a large number of people,[133] something he repeated in the 2014 general election.', 'Modi won the constituency of Maninagar, defeating Shweta Bhatt of the INC.[161] The BJP won 115 of the 182 seats,

Gujarat.\", 'He established financial and technology parks in the state and during the 2007 Vibrant Gujarat summit, real-estate investment deals worth ₹6.6 trillion (equivalent to ₹17 trillion or

southern Gujarat, such as the Sardar Sarovar Dam, were less successful.', 'The Sardar Sarovar project irrigated only 4–6% of the area intended.', '[164] In 2008, Modi offered land in Gujarat to Tata

electricity was rationed to fit scheduled irrigation demands, reducing its cost.', 'Early protests by farmers ended when those who benefitted found their electricity supply had stabilised[164] but,

'[464]\\nThis chapter provides an overview of computer security.', 'We begin with a discussion \\nof what we mean by computer security.', 'In essence, computer security deals with \\ncomputer-related assets that are subject to a variety of threats and for which various \\nmeasures are taken to protect those assets.', 'Accordingly, the next section of this \\nchapter provides a brief overview of the categories of computer-related assets that \\nusers and system managers wish to preserve and protect, and a look at the various \\nthreats and attacks that can be made on those assets.', 'Then, we survey the measures \\nthat can be taken to deal with such threats and attacks.', 'This we do from three dif\\x02ferent viewpoints, in Sections 1.3 through 1.5.', 'We then lay out in general terms a \\ncomputer security strategy.', 'The focus of this chapter, and indeed this book, is on three fundamental \\nquestions:\\n1.', 'What assets do we need to protect?', '2.', 'How are those assets threatened?', '3.', 'What can we do to counter those threats?', 'This definition introduces three key objectives that are at the heart of computer \\nsecurity:\\n• Confidentiality: This term covers two related concepts:\\n— Data confidentiality:1\\n Assures that private or confidential information is \\nnot made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals.', '— Privacy: Assures that individuals control or influence what information \\nrelated to them may be collected and stored and by whom and to whom that \\ninformation may be disclosed.', '• Integrity: This term covers two related concepts:\\n— Data integrity: Assures that information and programs are changed only \\nin a specified and authorized manner.', '— System integrity: Assures that a system performs its intended function in \\nan unimpaired manner, free from deliberate or inadvertent unauthorized \\nmanipulation of the system.', '• Availability: Assures that systems work promptly and service is not denied to \\nauthorized users.', 'These three concepts form what is often referred to as the CIA triad.', 'The three \\nconcepts embody the fundamental security objectives for both data and for information \\nand computing services.', 'For example, the NIST standard FIPS 199 (Standards for Security \\nCategorization of Federal Information and Information Systems, February 2004) lists con\\x02fidentiality, integrity, and availability as the three security objectives for information and \\nfor information systems.', 'FIPS 199 provides a useful characterization of these three objec\\x02tives in terms of requirements and the definition of a loss of security in each category:\\n• Confidentiality: Preserving authorized restrictions on information access and \\ndisclosure, including means for protecting personal privacy and proprietary infor\\x02mation.', 'A loss of confidentiality is the unauthorized disclosure of information.', '• Integrity: Guarding against improper information modification or destruction, \\nincluding ensuring information nonrepudiation and authenticity.', 'A loss of integ\\x02rity is the unauthorized modification or destruction of information.', '• Availability: Ensuring timely and reliable access to and use of information.', 'A loss of availability is the disruption of access to or use of information or an \\ninformation system.', 'Although the use of the CIA triad to define security objectives is well estab\\x02lished, some in the security field feel that additional concepts are needed to present a \\ncomplete picture (see Figure 1.1).', 'Two of the most commonly mentioned are as follows:\\n• Authenticity: The property of being genuine and being able to be verified and \\ntrusted; confidence in the validity of a transmission, a message, or messageoriginator.', 'This means verifying that users are who they say they are and that \\neach input arriving at the system came from a trusted source.', '• Accountability: The security goal that generates the requirement for actions \\nof an entity to be traced uniquely to that entity.', 'This supports nonrepudiation, \\ndeterrence, fault isolation, intrusion detection and prevention, and after-action \\nrecovery and legal action.', 'Because truly secure systems are not yet an achiev\\x02able goal, we must be able to trace a security breach to a responsible party.', 'Systems must keep records of their activities to permit later forensic analysis \\nto trace security breaches or to aid in transaction disputes.', 'Note that FIPS 199 includes authenticity under integrity.', 'Examples\\nWe now provide some examples of applications that illustrate the requirements just \\nenumerated.2\\n For these examples, we use three levels of impact on organizations or \\nindividuals should there be a breach of security (i.e., a loss of confidentiality, integrity, \\nor availability).', 'These levels are defined in FIPS 199:\\n• Low: The loss could be expected to have a limited adverse effect on organiza\\x02tional operations, organizational assets, or individuals.', 'A limited adverse effect \\nmeans that, for example, the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability \\nmight: (i) cause a degradation in mission capability to an extent and duration \\nthat the organization is able to perform its primary functions, but the effec\\x02tiveness of the functions is noticeably reduced; (ii) result in minor damage to \\norganizational assets; (iii) result in minor financial loss; or (iv) result in minor \\nharm to individuals.', 'Moderate: The loss could be expected to have a serious adverse effect on \\norganizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals.', 'A serious \\nadverse effect means that, for example, the loss might: (i) cause a significant \\ndegradation in mission capability to an extent and duration that the organiza\\x02tion is able to perform its primary functions, but the effectiveness of the func\\x02tions is significantly reduced; (ii) result in significant damage to organizational \\nassets; (iii) result in significant financial loss; or (iv) result in significant harm to \\nindividuals that does not involve loss of life or serious life-threatening injuries.', '• High:The loss could be expected to have a severe or catastrophic adverse effect \\non organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals.', 'A severe or \\ncatastrophic adverse effect means that, for example, the loss might: (i) cause a \\nsevere degradation in or loss of mission capability to an extent and duration \\nthat the organization is not able to perform one or more of its primary func\\x02tions; (ii) result in major damage to organizational assets; (iii) result in major \\nfinancial loss; or (iv) result in severe or catastrophic harm to individuals involv\\x02ing loss of life or serious life-threatening injuries.', 'Confidentiality Student grade information is an asset whose confidentiality is\\nconsidered to be highly important by students.', 'In the United States, the release of \\nsuch information is regulated by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act \\n(FERPA).', 'Grade information should only be available to students, their parents, and \\nemployees that require the information to do their job.', 'Student enrollment informa\\x02tion may have a moderate confidentiality rating.', 'While still covered by FERPA, this \\ninformation is seen by more people on a daily basis, is less likely to be targeted than \\ngrade information, and results in less damage if disclosed.', 'Directory information, such \\nas lists of students or faculty or departmental lists, may be assigned a low confiden\\x02tiality rating or indeed no rating.', 'This information is typically freely available to the \\npublic and published on a school’s website.', 'Integrity Several aspects of integrity are illustrated by the example of a hospital \\npatient’s allergy information stored in a database.', 'The doctor should be able to trust \\nthat the information is correct and current.', 'Now, suppose an employee (e.g., a nurse) \\nwho is authorized to view and update this information deliberately falsifies the data \\nto cause harm to the hospital.', 'The database needs to be restored to a trusted basis \\nquickly, and it should be possible to trace the error back to the person responsible.', 'Patient allergy information is an example of an asset with a high requirement for \\nintegrity.', 'Inaccurate information could result in serious harm or death to a patient, \\nand expose the hospital to massive liability.', 'An example of an asset that may be assigned a moderate level of integrity \\nrequirement is a website that offers a forum to registered users to discuss some spe\\x02cific topic.', 'Either a registered user or a hacker could falsify some entries or deface the \\nwebsite.', 'If the forum exists only for the enjoyment of the users, brings in little or no \\nadvertising revenue, and is not used for something important such as research, then \\npotential damage is not severe.', 'The Webmaster may experience some data, financial, \\nand time loss.', 'Availability The more critical a component or service is, the higher will be the \\nlevel of availability required.', 'Consider a system that provides authentication services \\nfor critical systems, applications, and devices.', 'An interruption of service results in the \\ninability for customers to access computing resources and staff to access the resources \\nthey need to perform critical tasks.', 'The loss of the service translates into a large \\nfinancial loss in lost employee productivity and potential customer loss.', 'An example of an asset that would typically be rated as having a moderate \\navailability requirement is a public website for a university; the website provides \\ninformation for current and prospective students and donors.', 'Such a site is not a \\ncritical component of the university’s information system, but its unavailability will \\ncause some embarrassment.', 'An online telephone directory lookup application would be classified as a low \\navailability requirement.', 'Although the temporary loss of the application may be an \\nannoyance, there are other ways to access the information, such as a hardcopy direc\\x02tory or the operator.', 'The Challenges of Computer Security\\nComputer security is both fascinating and complex.', 'Some of the reasons are as follows:\\n1.', 'Computer security is not as simple as it might first appear to the novice.', 'The \\nrequirements seem to be straightforward; indeed, most of the major require\\x02ments for security services can be given self-explanatory one-word labels: \\nconfidentiality, authentication, nonrepudiation, and integrity.', 'But the mecha\\x02nisms used to meet those requirements can be quite complex, and understanding \\nthem may involve rather subtle reasoning.', '2.', 'In developing a particular security mechanism or algorithm, one must always con\\x02sider potential attacks on those security features.', 'In many cases, successful attacks \\nare designed by looking at the problem in a completely different way, therefore \\nexploiting an unexpected weakness in the mechanism.', '3.', 'Because of Point 2, the procedures used to provide particular services are often \\ncounterintuitive.', 'Typically, a security mechanism is complex, and it is not obvious \\nfrom the statement of a particular requirement that such elaborate measures are \\nneeded.', 'Only when the various aspects of the threat are considered do elaborate \\nsecurity mechanisms make sense.', '4.', 'Having designed various security mechanisms, it is necessary to decide where to \\nuse them.', 'This is true both in terms of physical placement (e.g., at what points in \\na network are certain security mechanisms needed) and in a logical sense [e.g., \\nat what layer or layers of an architecture such as TCP/IP (Transmission Control \\nProtocol/Internet Protocol) should mechanisms be placed].', 'Security mechanisms typically involve more than a particular algorithm or \\nprotocol.', 'They also require that participants be in possession of some secret \\ninformation (e.g., an encryption key), which raises questions about the creation, \\ndistribution, and protection of that secret information.', 'There may also be a reli\\x02ance on communications protocols whose behavior may complicate the task ofdeveloping the security mechanism.', 'For example, if the proper functioning of the \\nsecurity mechanism requires setting time limits on the transit time of a message \\nfrom sender to receiver, then any protocol or network that introduces variable, \\nunpredictable delays may render such time limits meaningless.', '6.', 'Computer security is essentially a battle of wits between a perpetrator who tries \\nto find holes, and the designer or administrator who tries to close them.', 'The great \\nadvantage that the attacker has is that he or she need only find a single weak\\x02ness, while the designer must find and eliminate all weaknesses to achieve perfect \\nsecurity.', '7.', 'There is a natural tendency on the part of users and system managers to perceive \\nlittle benefit from security investment until a security failure occurs.', '8.', 'Security requires regular, even constant monitoring, and this is difficult in today’s \\nshort-term, overloaded environment.', '9.', 'Security is still too often an afterthought to be incorporated into a system after\\nthe design is complete, rather than being an integral part of the design process.', '10.', 'Many users and even security administrators view strong security as an impedi\\x02ment to efficient and user-friendly operation of an information system or use \\nof information.', 'The difficulties just enumerated will be encountered in numerous ways as we \\nexamine the various security threats and mechanisms throughout this book.', 'A Model for Computer Security\\nWe now introduce some terminology that will be useful throughout the book.3 Table \\n1.1 defines terms and Figure 1.2, based on [CCPS12a], shows the relationship among \\nsome of these terms.', 'We start with the concept of a system resource or asset, that \\nusers and owners wish to protect.', 'The assets of a computer system can be categorized \\nas follows:\\n• Hardware: Including computer systems and other data processing, data storage, \\nand data communications devices.', '• Software: Including the operating system, system utilities, and applications.', '• Data: Including files and databases, as well as security-related data, such as \\npassword files.', '• Communication facilities and networks: Local and wide area network com\\x02munication links, bridges, routers, and so on.', 'In the context of security, our concern is with the vulnerabilities of system \\nresources.', '[NRC02] lists the following general categories of vulnerabilities of a com\\x02puter system or network asset:\\n• The system can be corrupted, so it does the wrong thing or gives wrong answers.', 'For example, stored data values may differ from what they should be because \\nthey have been improperly modified.', 'Corresponding to the various types of vulnerabilities to a system resource are \\nthreats that are capable of exploiting those vulnerabilities.', 'A threat represents a \\npotential security harm to an asset.', 'An attack is a threat that is carried out (threat \\naction) and, if successful, leads to an undesirable violation of security, or threat con\\x02sequence.', 'The agent carrying out the attack is referred to as an attacker or threat \\nagent.', 'We can distinguish two types of attacks:\\n• Active attack: An attempt to alter system resources or affect their operation.', '• Passive attack: An attempt to learn or make use of information from the system \\nthat does not affect system resources.', 'We can also classify attacks based on the origin of the attack:\\n• Inside attack: Initiated by an entity inside the security perimeter (an “insider”).', 'The insider is authorized to access system resources but uses them in a way not \\napproved by those who granted the authorization.', '• Outside attack: Initiated from outside the perimeter, by an unauthorized or ille\\x02gitimate user of the system (an “outsider”).', 'On the Internet, potential outside \\nattackers range from amateur pranksters to organized criminals, international \\nterrorists, and hostile governments.', 'Finally, a countermeasure is any means taken to deal with a security attack.', 'Ideally, a countermeasure can be devised to prevent a particular type of attack from \\nsucceeding.', 'When prevention is not possible, or fails in some instance, the goal is to \\ndetect the attack then recover from the effects of the attack.', 'A countermeasure may \\nitself introduce new vulnerabilities.', 'In any case, residual vulnerabilities may remain \\nafter the imposition of countermeasures.', 'Such vulnerabilities may be exploited by \\nthreat agents representing a residual level of risk to the assets.', 'Owners will seek to \\nminimize that risk given other constraints.', '1.2 THREATS, ATTACKS, AND ASSETS\\nWe now turn to a more detailed look at threats, attacks, and assets.', 'First, we look at \\nthe types of security threats that must be dealt with, and then give some examples of \\nthe types of threats that apply to different categories of assets.', 'Threats and Attacks\\nTable 1.2, based on RFC 4949, describes four kinds of threat consequences and lists \\nthe kinds of attacks that result in each consequence.', 'Unauthorized disclosure is a threat to confidentiality.', 'The following types of \\nattacks can result in this threat consequence:\\n• Exposure: This can be deliberate, as when an insider intentionally releases sen\\x02sitive information, such as credit card numbers, to an outsider.', 'It can also be \\nthe result of a human, hardware, or software error, which results in an entity \\ngaining unauthorized knowledge of sensitive data.', 'There have been numerous instances of this, such as universities accidentally posting confidential student \\ninformation on the Web.', '• Interception: Interception is a common attack in the context of communica\\x02tions.', 'On a shared local area network (LAN), such as a wireless LAN or a \\nbroadcast Ethernet, any device attached to the LAN can receive a copy of \\npackets intended for another device.', 'On the Internet, a determined hacker can \\ngain access to e-mail traffic and other data transfers.', 'All of these situations cre\\x02ate the potential for unauthorized access to data.', '• Inference: An example of inference is known as traffic analysis, in which an \\nadversary is able to gain information from observing the pattern of traffic on \\na network, such as the amount of traffic between particular pairs of hosts on \\nthe network.', 'Another example is the inference of detailed information from a \\ndatabase by a user who has only limited access; this is accomplished by repeated \\nqueries whose combined results enable inference.', '• Intrusion: An example of intrusion is an adversary gaining unauthorized access \\nto sensitive data by overcoming the system’s access control protections.', 'Deception is a threat to either system integrity or data integrity.', 'The following \\ntypes of attacks can result in this threat consequence:\\n• Masquerade: One example of masquerade is an attempt by an unauthorized \\nuser to gain access to a system by posing as an authorized user; this could hap\\x02pen if the unauthorized user has learned another user’s logon ID and password.', 'Another example is malicious logic, such as a Trojan horse, that appears to \\nperform a useful or desirable function but actually gains unauthorized access \\nto system resources, or tricks a user into executing other malicious logic.', '• Falsification: This refers to the altering or replacing of valid data or the intro\\x02duction of false data into a file or database.', 'For example, a student may alter \\nhis or her grades on a school database.', '• Repudiation: In this case, a user either denies sending data, or a user denies \\nreceiving or possessing the data.', 'Disruption is a threat to availability or system integrity.', 'The following types of \\nattacks can result in this threat consequence:\\n• Incapacitation: This is an attack on system availability.', 'This could occur as a \\nresult of physical destruction of or damage to system hardware.', 'More typically, \\nmalicious software, such as Trojan horses, viruses, or worms, could operate in \\nsuch a way as to disable a system or some of its services.', '• Corruption: This is an attack on system integrity.', 'Malicious software in this \\ncontext could operate in such a way that system resources or services function \\nin an unintended manner.', 'Or a user could gain unauthorized access to a system \\nand modify some of its functions.', 'An example of the latter is a user placing \\nbackdoor logic in the system to provide subsequent access to a system and its \\nresources by other than the usual procedure.', '• Obstruction: One way to obstruct system operation is to interfere with commu\\x02nications by disabling communication links or altering communication control \\ninformation.', 'Another way is to overload the system by placing excess burden \\non communication traffic or processing resources.', 'Usurpation is a threat to system integrity.', 'The following types of attacks can \\nresult in this threat consequence:\\n• Misappropriation: This can include theft of service.', 'An example is a distributed \\ndenial of service attack, when malicious software is installed on a number of hosts \\nto be used as platforms to launch traffic at a target host.', 'In this case, the malicious \\nsoftware makes unauthorized use of processor and operating system resources.', '• Misuse: Misuse can occur by means of either malicious logic or a hacker that \\nhas gained unauthorized access to a system.', 'In either case, security functions \\ncan be disabled or thwarted.', 'Hardware A major threat to computer system hardware is the threat to availabil\\x02ity.', 'Hardware is the most vulnerable to attack and the least susceptible to automated \\ncontrols.', 'Threats include accidental and deliberate damage to equipment as well as \\ntheft.', 'The proliferation of personal computers and workstations and the widespread \\nuse of LANs increase the potential for losses in this area.', 'Theft of USB drives can \\nlead to loss of confidentiality.', 'Physical and administrative security measures are \\nneeded to deal with these threats.', 'Software Software includes the operating system, utilities, and application pro\\x02grams.', 'A key threat to software is an attack on availability.', 'Software, especially \\napplication software, is often easy to delete.', 'Software can also be altered or damaged \\nto render it useless.', 'Careful software configuration management, which includes \\nmaking backups of the most recent version of software, can maintain high avail\\x02ability.', 'A more difficult problem to deal with is software modification that results \\nin a program that still functions but that behaves differently than before, which is a \\nthreat to integrity/authenticity.', 'Computer viruses and related attacks fall into this \\ncategory.', 'A final problem is protection against software piracy.', 'Data Hardware and software security are typically concerns of computing cen\\x02ter professionals or individual concerns of personal computer users.', 'A much more \\nwidespread problem is data security, which involves files and other forms of data \\ncontrolled by individuals, groups, and business organizations.', 'Security concerns with respect to data are broad, encompassing availability, \\nsecrecy, and integrity.', 'In the case of availability, the concern is with the destruction \\nof data files, which can occur either accidentally or maliciously.', 'The obvious concern with secrecy is the unauthorized reading of data files or \\ndatabases, and this area has been the subject of perhaps more research and effort \\nthan any other area of computer security.', 'A less obvious threat to secrecy involves the \\nanalysis of data and manifests itself in the use of so-called statistical databases, which \\nprovide summary or aggregate information.', 'Presumably, the existence of aggregate \\ninformation does not threaten the privacy of the individuals involved.', 'However, as \\nthe use of statistical databases grows, there is an increasing potential for disclosure \\nof personal information.', 'In essence, characteristics of constituent individuals may be \\nidentified through careful analysis.', 'For example, if one table records the aggregate of \\nthe incomes of respondents A, B, C, and D and another records the aggregate of the \\nincomes of A, B, C, D, and E, the difference between the two aggregates would be the \\nincome of E. This problem is exacerbated by the increasing desire to combine data \\nsets.', 'In many cases, matching several sets of data for consistency at different levels \\nof aggregation requires access to individual units.', 'Thus, the individual units, which \\nare the subject of privacy concerns, are available at various stages in the processing \\nof data sets.Communication Lines and Networks Network security attacks can be classified \\nas passive attacks and active attacks.', 'A passive attack attempts to learn or make use of \\ninformation from the system, but does not affect system resources.', 'An active attack \\nattempts to alter system resources or affect their operation.', 'Passive attacks are in the nature of eavesdropping on, or monitoring of, trans\\x02missions.', 'The goal of the attacker is to obtain information that is being transmit\\x02ted.', 'Two types of passive attacks are the release of message contents and traffic \\nanalysis.', 'The release of message contents is easily understood.', 'A telephone conversation, \\nan electronic mail message, and a transferred file may contain sensitive or confiden\\x02tial information.', 'We would like to prevent an opponent from learning the contents \\nof these transmissions.', 'A second type of passive attack, traffic analysis, is more subtle.', 'Suppose we \\nhad a way of masking the contents of messages or other information traffic so oppo\\x02nents, even if they captured the message, could not extract the information from \\nthe message.', 'The common technique for masking contents is encryption.', 'If we had \\nencryption protection in place, an opponent might still be able to observe the pattern\\nof these messages.', 'The opponent could determine the location and identity of com\\x02municating hosts and could observe the frequency and length of messages being \\nexchanged.', 'This information might be useful in guessing the nature of the communi\\x02cation that was taking place.', 'Passive attacks are very difficult to detect because they do not involve any \\nalteration of the data.', 'Typically, the message traffic is sent and received in an appar\\x02ently normal fashion and neither the sender nor receiver is aware that a third party \\nhas read the messages or observed the traffic pattern.', 'However, it is feasible to pre\\x02vent the success of these attacks, usually by means of encryption.', 'Thus, the emphasis \\nin dealing with passive attacks is on prevention rather than detection.', 'Active attacks involve some modification of the data stream or the creation \\nof a false stream, and can be subdivided into four categories: replay, masquerade, \\nmodification of messages, and denial of service.', 'Replay involves the passive capture of a data unit and its subsequent retrans\\x02mission to produce an unauthorized effect.', 'A masquerade takes place when one entity pretends to be a different entity.', 'A masquerade attack usually includes one of the other forms of active attack.', 'For \\nexample, authentication sequences can be captured and replayed after a valid \\nauthentication sequence has taken place, thus enabling an authorized entity with \\nfew privileges to obtain extra privileges by impersonating an entity that has those \\nprivileges.', 'Modification of messages simply means that some portion of a legitimate \\nmessage is altered, or that messages are delayed or reordered, to produce an unau\\x02thorized effect.', 'For example, a message stating, “Allow John Smith to read confi\\x02dential file accounts” is modified to say, “Allow Fred Brown to read confidential \\nfile accounts.”There are a number of ways of classifying and characterizing the countermeasures \\nthat may be used to reduce vulnerabilities and deal with threats to system assets.', 'In \\nthis section, we view countermeasures in terms of functional requirements, and we \\nfollow the classification defined in FIPS 200 (Minimum Security Requirements for \\nFederal Information and Information Systems).', 'This standard enumerates 17 security\\x02related areas with regard to protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of \\ninformation systems and the information processed, stored, and transmitted by those \\nsystems.', 'The areas are defined in Table 1.4.', 'The requirements listed in FIPS 200 encompass a wide range of counter\\x02measures to security vulnerabilities and threats.', 'Roughly, we can divide these \\ncountermeasures into two categories: those that require computer security technical \\nmeasures (covered in Parts One and Two), either hardware or software, or both; and \\nthose that are fundamentally management issues (covered in Part Three).', 'Each of the functional areas may involve both computer security technical mea\\x02sures and management measures.', 'Functional areas that primarily require computer \\nsecurity technical measures include access control, identification and authentica\\x02tion, system and communication protection, and system and information integrity.', 'Functional areas that primarily involve management controls and procedures include \\nawareness and training; audit and accountability; certification, accreditation, and \\nsecurity assessments; contingency planning; maintenance; physical and environmen\\x02tal protection; planning; personnel security; risk assessment; and systems and services \\nacquisition.', 'Functional areas that overlap computer security technical measures and \\nmanagement controls include configuration management, incident response, and \\nmedia protection.', 'The first eight listed principles were first proposed in [SALT75] and have with\\x02stood the test of time.', 'In this section, we briefly discuss each principle.', 'Economy of mechanism means the design of security measures embodied in \\nboth hardware and software should be as simple and small as possible.', 'The motiva\\x02tion for this principle is that relatively simple, small design is easier to test and verify \\nthoroughly.', 'With a complex design, there are many more opportunities for an adver\\x02sary to discover subtle weaknesses to exploit that may be difficult to spot ahead of \\ntime.', 'The more complex the mechanism is, the more likely it is to possess exploitable \\nflaws.', 'Simple mechanisms tend to have fewer exploitable flaws and require less \\nmaintenance.', 'Furthermore, because configuration management issues are simpli\\x02fied, updating or replacing a simple mechanism becomes a less intensive process.', 'In practice, this is perhaps the most difficult principle to honor.', 'There is a constant \\ndemand for new features in both hardware and software, complicating the security \\ndesign task.', 'The best that can be done is to keep this principle in mind during system \\ndesign to try to eliminate unnecessary complexity.', 'Fail-safe default means access decisions should be based on permission rather \\nthan exclusion.', 'That is, the default situation is lack of access, and the protection \\nscheme identifies conditions under which access is permitted.', 'This approach exhibits \\na better failure mode than the alternative approach, where the default is to per\\x02mit access.', 'A design or implementation mistake in a mechanism that gives explicit \\npermission tends to fail by refusing permission, a safe situation that can be quickly \\ndetected.', 'On the other hand, a design or implementation mistake in a mechanism that \\nexplicitly excludes access tends to fail by allowing access, a failure that may long go \\nunnoticed in normal use.', 'For example, most file access systems work on this principle \\nand virtually all protected services on client/server systems work this way.', 'Complete mediation means every access must be checked against the access \\ncontrol mechanism.', 'Systems should not rely on access decisions retrieved from \\na cache.', 'In a system designed to operate continuously, this principle requires that, if \\naccess decisions are remembered for future use, careful consideration be given to how \\nchanges in authority are propagated into such local memories.', 'File access systems \\nappear to provide an example of a system that complies with this principle.', 'However, \\ntypically, once a user has opened a file, no check is made to see of permissions change.', 'To fully implement complete mediation, every time a user reads a field or record \\nin a file, or a data item in a database, the system must exercise access control.', 'This \\nresource-intensive approach is rarely used.', 'Open design means the design of a security mechanism should be open rather \\nthan secret.', 'For example, although encryption keys must be secret, encryption \\nalgorithms should be open to public scrutiny.', 'The algorithms can then be reviewed \\nby many experts, and users can therefore have high confidence in them.', 'This is the \\nphilosophy behind the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) pro\\x02gram of standardizing encryption and hash algorithms, and has led to the widespread \\nadoption of NIST-approved algorithms.', 'Separation of privilege is defined in [SALT75] as a practice in which multiple \\nprivilege attributes are required to achieve access to a restricted resource.', 'A good \\nexample of this is multifactor user authentication, which requires the use of mul\\x02tiple techniques, such as a password and a smart card, to authorize a user.', 'The term \\nis also now applied to any technique in which a program is divided into parts that \\nare limited to the specific privileges they require in order to perform a specific \\ntask.', 'This is used to mitigate the potential damage of a computer security attack.', 'One example of this latter interpretation of the principle is removing high privilege \\noperations to another process and running that process with the higher privileges \\nrequired to perform its tasks.', 'Day-to-day interfaces are executed in a lower privi\\x02leged process.', 'Least privilege means every process and every user of the system should operate\\nusing the least set of privileges necessary to perform the task.', 'A good example of the \\nuse of this principle is role-based access control, as will be described in Chapter 4.', 'The \\nsystem security policy can identify and define the various roles of users or processes.', 'Each role is assigned only those permissions needed to perform its functions.', 'Each \\npermission specifies a permitted access to a particular resource (such as read and \\nwrite access to a specified file or directory, and connect access to a given host and \\nport).', 'Unless permission is granted explicitly, the user or process should not be able \\nto access the protected resource.', 'More generally, any access control system should \\nallow each user only the privileges that are authorized for that user.', 'There is also a \\ntemporal aspect to the least privilege principle.', 'For example, system programs or \\nadministrators who have special privileges should have those privileges only when \\nnecessary; when they are doing ordinary activities the privileges should be withdrawn.', 'Leaving them in place just opens the door to accidents.', 'Least common mechanism means the design should minimize the functions \\nshared by different users, providing mutual security.', 'This principle helps reduce the \\nnumber of unintended communication paths and reduces the amount of hardware \\nand software on which all users depend, thus making it easier to verify if there are \\nany undesirable security implications.', 'Psychological acceptability implies the security mechanisms should not \\ninterfere unduly with the work of users, and at the same time meet the needs of \\nthose who authorize access.', 'If security mechanisms hinder the usability or acces\\x02sibility of resources, users may opt to turn off those mechanisms.', 'Where possible, \\nsecurity mechanisms should be transparent to the users of the system or at most \\nintroduce minimal obstruction.', 'In addition to not being intrusive or burdensome, \\nsecurity procedures must reflect the user’s mental model of protection.', 'If the pro\\x02tection procedures do not make sense to the user or if the user, must translate his \\nor her image of protection into a substantially different protocol, the user is likely \\nto make errors.Isolation is a principle that applies in three contexts.', 'First, public access systems \\nshould be isolated from critical resources (data, processes, etc.)', 'to prevent disclo\\x02sure or tampering.', 'In cases where the sensitivity or criticality of the information is \\nhigh, organizations may want to limit the number of systems on which that data are \\nstored and isolate them, either physically or logically.', 'Physical isolation may include \\nensuring that no physical connection exists between an organization’s public access \\ninformation resources and an organization’s critical information.', 'When implement\\x02ing logical isolation solutions, layers of security services and mechanisms should \\nbe established between public systems and secure systems that is responsible for \\nprotecting critical resources.', 'Second, the processes and files of individual users should \\nbe isolated from one another except where it is explicitly desired.', 'All modern oper\\x02ating systems provide facilities for such isolation, so individual users have separate, \\nisolated process space, memory space, and file space, with protections for preventing \\nunauthorized access.', 'And finally, security mechanisms should be isolated in the sense \\nof preventing access to those mechanisms.', 'For example, logical access control may \\nprovide a means of isolating cryptographic software from other parts of the host \\nsystem and for protecting cryptographic software from tampering and the keys from \\nreplacement or disclosure.', 'Encapsulation can be viewed as a specific form of isolation based on object\\x02oriented functionality.', 'Protection is provided by encapsulating a collection of pro\\x02cedures and data objects in a domain of its own so that the internal structure of a \\ndata object is accessible only to the procedures of the protected subsystem and the \\nprocedures may be called only at designated domain entry points.', 'Modularity in the context of security refers both to the development of secu\\x02rity functions as separate, protected modules, and to the use of a modular architec\\x02ture for mechanism design and implementation.', 'With respect to the use of separate \\nsecurity modules, the design goal here is to provide common security functions \\nand services, such as cryptographic functions, as common modules.', 'For example, \\nnumerous protocols and applications make use of cryptographic functions.', 'Rather \\nthan implementing such functions in each protocol or application, a more secure \\ndesign is provided by developing a common cryptographic module that can be \\ninvoked by numerous protocols and applications.', 'The design and implementation \\neffort can then focus on the secure design and implementation of a single crypto\\x02graphic module, including mechanisms to protect the module from tampering.', 'With \\nrespect to the use of a modular architecture, each security mechanism should be \\nable to support migration to new technology or upgrade of new features without \\nrequiring an entire system redesign.', 'The security design should be modular so that \\nindividual parts of the security design can be upgraded without the requirement to \\nmodify the entire system.', 'Layering refers to the use of multiple, overlapping protection approaches \\naddressing the people, technology, and operational aspects of information systems.', 'By using multiple, overlapping protection approaches, the failure or circumvention \\nof any individual protection approach will not leave the system unprotected.', 'We will \\nsee throughout this book that a layering approach is often used to provide multiple \\nbarriers between an adversary and protected information or services.', 'This technique \\nis often referred to as defense in depth.']\n"
